# Natural Disasters Twitter analysis
## by Javier Alonso Alonso

> In this project, itÂ´s analysed disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

> The project contains a set of real messages that were sent during disaster events and it will be created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that a message could be send to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

## Dataset

> There are two initial datasets:
> - Messages:it contains information on the twitter messages: the original twit, the translated into English twit and the source
> - Categories: it contains the categorization of all the messages into different categories


## ETL_Pipeline_Preparation

> The final dataframe is prepared from both initial dataframes and saved the result to a sqllite databes

## ML_Pipeline_Preparation

> The pipeline for building the machine learning algorithm is prepared in this section.
